# Calculator App

Welcome to my calculator app!

This was a project I completed for Meta'a Front-End Developer course, and my first ever React app. We were tasked with a creating a simple looking calculator to test our knowledge on basic React concepts.

## Technologies used:

- HTML
- CSS
- React
- Create React App
- Figma

## Project Overview

The initial requirements to complete the project was to ensure the calculator's logic worked, which required me to understand concepts like both the useState and useRef hooks, as well as how to create a controlled form.

However, since completing the project, I have gone back into the CSS to transform the calculator into a much better looking app. Which now incorporates my UX/UI skills I developed in a later chapter of Meta's course that taught Figma. Here are images of before and after.

Overall, this was a very fulfilling project to complete as it significantly increased my React skills. From basic concepts such as how a Create React App template looks like, to more advanced skills like using multiple hooks within one onClick event assigned to a button. Additionally, by transforming the calculator's aesthetic to create a better user experience, I also sharped my CSS skills like CSS grid.

## Installation

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/acktreptow/react-calculator.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-calculator`
3. Type npm start into the command line.

## Future Enhancements

I would like to add even more buttons at some point, for example, a decimal point for further functionality. However, other uncompleted projects will take priority for the foreseeable future.
